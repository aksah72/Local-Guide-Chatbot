Make Chatbot Using API
1. Utilize the Relevant Tools

Use Flask (or your preferred backend framework) to handle API calls and responses.

Implement HTML/CSS/JavaScript for a clean, interactive frontend.

Optionally, use the OpenAI API to add a conversational chatbot experience.

2. Fetch Relevant API

Connect to the Google Places API or similar services to get real-time local data.

Fetch attractions, restaurants, parks, and more based on the user's location.

Extract useful info like ratings, opening hours, photos, and addresses.

3. Integrate and Personalize

Embed the API data into your frontend or chatbot interface.

Personalize recommendations based on user preferences (e.g. food, nature, historical places).

Make the experience interactive and location-aware.
